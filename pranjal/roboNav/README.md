@harman - here are few pointers for you
1) setup a pipeline so that both our codes can communicate if your code is not in c/c++
2) I hope your code is now about to model free space, smoothen the trajectory and move through points p1,p2,..on.
3) Also it would be nice if you could decide the input and output format/protocol of communication of your code is ready so I will adjust accordingly OR if you are okay to adjust then ping me I will specify the format. 
4) Well that's it from my side, questions if any please ask.
